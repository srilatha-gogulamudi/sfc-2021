The Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) framework from Microsoft is a broad and complex product. To use the Workflow Module effectively, you should be familiar with WF and WCF technologies and understand how client-server apps are built and communicate. Our integration with WF includes the implementation of custom workflow instance stores, whose correct operation greatly depends on the quality and amount of WF documentation and other public information on the subject. That said, we do not recommend using our Workflow module if your project specifics or other business requirements do not allow you to research possible problems that may emerge (due to WF or our integration specifics) in several days OR if these problems cannot be reproduced in another environment OR if you cannot provide direct or remote access (through a VPN or by means of specialized communication tools) to the problematic applications, its source files and environments these applications are running in for our engineers.
